My Hackintosh configuration for the following specs:
- Biostar H410MHG
- Intel Core i3 10100
- AMD RX560
- Gigabyte M.2 NVMe 256GB (GP-GSM2NE8256GNTD)
- RTL8111 Ethernet (on-board)

## Notes
- Sleep is the only thing that doesn't function properly. The PC goes into the sleep mode and instantly wakes up. If 
you have any ideas on how to fix this, feel free to let me know.

- As a surprise to me, the SBUS kext isn't *really* needed, as macOS deteced the serial buses without any issues. 
Although, I included it anyway, just to be safe.

- For obvious reasons, I didn't include the Serial Number, ROM, MLB and UUID. Get your own.
